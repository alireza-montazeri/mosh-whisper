Hi, I’m Sam Tan. Assigned female at birth, and I’m not pregnant or breastfeeding. I’m 168 centimeters tall and weigh 92 kilograms. My waist is 38 inches.

I want to lose weight mainly to become healthier and feel better day to day—more energy for my kids and less knee pain. I’ve tried before—various diets, some intermittent fasting, and the gym—but the results didn’t stick. It’s been about four to five years since I was at my ideal weight.

Lately my mood is around three out of five. I’d call my diet ‘healthy-ish’. I am loosely following a Mediterranean-style approach. I eat out about two to three times a week, get takeaway maybe zero to one times a week, and I snack every day. Processed foods are about two to three times per week. I do have fruit and veg daily. Soft drinks are rare—maybe once a week. I don’t smoke. I often sleep under seven hours and I’m frequently under stress.

My physical fitness is OK. I get roughly two and a half to five hours of moderate activity a week. My weight does interfere a little with exercise, mostly joint discomfort. I don’t have any of the serious conditions you flagged and no related family issues like thyroid tumors or MEN. Past medical conditions—just mild childhood asthma. I’m not on any regular medications or supplements. I do have a penicillin allergy—rash.

No diabetes for me; there is a family history—my dad has type 2. No known family heart disease. I don’t vomit after overeating, but sometimes I feel like I’ve lost control with portions. Food doesn’t dominate my life though.

My date of birth is 12 July 1991. Ethnically, I’m Asian. I’m open to either tablets or injections—leaning tablets because I’m not great with needles, but I’ll follow the doctor’s advice. This journey is very important to me.
